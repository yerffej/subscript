    <p class="description">Although this is mostly a static site, it is built using react and is fully responsive. I built out the front end and react components, including the <a href="http://impact.all4ed.org/#interactive">interactive piece</a> which displays different data sets based on your selection (including a dynamic little pie chart).</p>
